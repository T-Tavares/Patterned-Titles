/* ------------------------ PATTERND TITLES ----------------------- */

That is the first program I've ever built that wasn't from an online tutorial or course homework. It's a simple program that helps me keep my code organised by creating patterned titles and subtitles in a comment format. And although it was the first program I made, I've been using it in all my studies and projects.

Note..: The read me file on GitHub preview shows the titles in different sizes due to the font used. Check raw version to see how it looks on vs code.

/* ---------------------- FUNCTION ARGUMENTS ---------------------- */

The function gets three arguments

titleString = String String of your title. The function will UpperCase your string // comment line 20 if to prevent it.

titleLength = Integer That will determine the length of the title in characters I recommend something around 70. Minimum of 30. ( For very short titles/subtitles ) If you chose a odd number It'll be add +1 for symetry purposes.

printTitle( titleString, titleLength, titleType) title Type = String Chose either 'title' for a 3 lines higher title or'subtitle' for a single line subtitle. Note. leave it blank or typing anything that's not 'subtitle' will return a 3 lines high title.

/* ---------------------------- OUTPUT ---------------------------- */

It'll log the title to your console and copy it to your clipboard.

/* ----------------------- COPY TO CLIPBOARD ---------------------- */
